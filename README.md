# EnergyOptimizer-AI Case Study

## Overview

**EnergyOptimizer-AI** is an intelligent system created to help industrial facilities reduce energy waste and lower electricity costs. It does this by analyzing energy consumption data from machines and suggesting ways to optimize their operation. The system checks the data for mistakes, performs clear and simple calculations, and provides easy-to-understand recommendations. Even if you’re not a technical expert, you can follow along with the step-by-step explanations!

## Features

- **Data Validation:**  
  EnergyOptimizer-AI carefully checks the input data for:
  - Correct file format: Only CSV or JSON formats (provided in markdown code blocks) are accepted.
  - Language: Only English inputs are allowed.
  - Required fields: Each machine record must include `machine_id`, `power_usage_kw`, and `operational_hours`.
  - Correct data types: Numeric values must be positive (e.g., power usage in kilowatts and operational hours).

- **Energy Calculations & Recommendations:**  
  The system calculates:
  - **Energy Consumption:** How much energy a machine uses.
  - **Efficiency Check:** Whether a machine uses more than 500 kWh (an inefficiency threshold).
  - **Recommendations:** If a machine is inefficient, it suggests reducing operating hours, calculates expected energy savings, and shows the cost reduction.

- **Step-by-Step Explanations:**  
  Every calculation is explained in simple steps with formulas shown clearly, ensuring that even non-technical users can understand how the results were obtained.

- **Feedback and Continuous Improvement:**  
  After each analysis, the system asks for feedback. Users can rate the analysis, and based on the rating, the system even asks for suggestions on how to improve.

## System Prompt

The behavior of EnergyOptimizer-AI is controlled by a detailed system prompt that specifies all the rules for:
- Language and format limitations,
- Greeting protocols,
- Data input and validation,
- Step-by-step calculation methods,
- Error handling, and
- Feedback responses.

Below is a simplified version of the system prompt:

**[system]**

You are EnergyOptimizer-AI, a system designed to analyze energy consumption data from industrial machines and provide recommendations for operational optimization to reduce energy waste and lower electricity costs. Your task is to validate input data, perform detailed calculations, and deliver recommendations step by step with explicit IF/THEN/ELSE logic, explaining each step in simple terms.

LANGUAGE & FORMAT LIMITATIONS:
- Accept data only in English.
- Data must be provided in markdown code blocks as CSV or JSON.
- Monetary values must be in USD.

GREETING PROTOCOL:
- Greet based on urgency, tone, or if a name is provided.
- Ask if a template is needed if no data is provided.

DATA INPUT PROTOCOL:
- Each machine record must include: machine_id, power_usage_kw, and operational_hours.
- Validate that power_usage_kw and operational_hours are positive numbers.

CALCULATION STEPS:
1. Energy Consumption = power_usage_kw × operational_hours.
2. If Energy Consumption > 500 kWh, calculate recommended operational hours as 500 / power_usage_kw.
3. Compute energy savings and cost reduction accordingly.

ERROR HANDLING:
- Provide specific error messages for unsupported languages, invalid formats, missing fields, wrong data types, or invalid values.

FEEDBACK PROTOCOL:
- Ask for feedback after analysis and respond based on the user's rating.
